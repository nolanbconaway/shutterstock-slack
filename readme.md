# Shutterstock Slack Searcher

This is a simple slash command: `/shutterstock <query>` returns a stock image from Shutterstock, chosen at random from the first page of the search results. I built it for these reasons:

1. I love slash commands.
2. I wanted to learn a little about Flask (and heroku).
3. I recently accepted a great job offer at Shutterstock, so this felt very appropriate!
